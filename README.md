# Bubble, a virtual operating system for chatbots

Bubble isn't just a framework. It's a **virtual operating system** specifically designed for managing complex chatbots. Bubble is designed to handle many common issues in modern chatbots: numerous messaging formats offered in different instant messaging apps, process scheduling, as well as the need to expose your IP address for the sake of webhooks. Bubble also takes care of your service quota and managing users and accounts to deliver the best omnichannel experience despite all the constraints.

Bubble is inspired by [Ika](https://github.com/reinhart1010/ika), an unfinished chatbot library by [Reinhart Previano K. (@reinhart1010)](https://reinhart1010.id), combined with his ambitions to build [an official cyborg account](https://github.com/reinhart1010/pr0xy). This new operating system will also be used for his internal automation services in the near future. However, unlike Ika, Bubble is designed to run as a whole operating system, instead of providing generic utilities to send messages.

Our official mascot is [Shiftine](https://reinhart1010.id/author/shiftine), who's now completely made up of recycled plastic materials glued with her favorite project Caps.
